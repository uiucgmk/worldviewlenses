He's just an all-around rude person. <br>To be fair, he hired females in the 70's to be high level directors. Trump critics can't fight against that. Plus, he insults and degrade men as well.<br>As for the racist portion, Trump is extremely against illegal and undocumented immigrants. \nTo the democrats who advocate \fairness and equality\", how is it fair that the legal immigrants have to go through a stringent immigration process to get into the United States while illegals should get a easy, free path? If you really advocate equality, shouldn't you adhere to stricter border security while making legal immigration easier? While Trump's position is radical, he has a point. And remember, his wife is an immigrant. <br>So while I absolutely hate Trump's extremism, I congratulate him on winning over a cheater, killer, and shameless politician who undermines minority rights, Hillary Rodham Clinton."

She did this in Benghazi and now to those who stayed at NY HQ until 3am.

          I find it strange that now the very people who have been fanning the flames of hate and division telling us to unite and come together.  Seriously?! I want nothing to do with the values you hold dear. I can't associate with such vile and hatred. I will keep my head down, raise my family in love, teach my little ones that doing the right thing is not always the easy thing and hopefully in four years we will wake up from this nightmare.
