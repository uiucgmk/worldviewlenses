As Donald Trump himself said in a tweet  he would have campaigned in states like California and New York if elections went off of just the overall vote totals. Instead  candidates are forced to campaign in  and listen to the people of  smaller  less-populated states like New Hampshire  Wisconsin  North Carolina  Colorado  Nevada  and so on.\\n\\nBoth parties know this.

aS'more proof of gerrymandering. The map of counties in red and blue shows the mathematics of it. The votes by county are in the realm of probability but not naturally possible. Someone moved the groups after the 2010 census to favor Republicans in the electoral college. Consultants were hired to help restructure the voting districts but no one was hired or no judicial branch was used to check their restructuring. Done on trust unfortunately. American public has every right to scream at the top of its lungs for such violation of the voting system. This time it was local officials who did it by one to two percent. Not enough to get noticed but district after district accumulates resulting in one party winning the electoral college and the other party winning the popular vote.  Gerrymandering is illegal.  It will not happen again.  http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/gop-gerrymandering-creates-uphill-fight-dems-house/'
