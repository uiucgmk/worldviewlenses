First of all Marco the use of the word Nazi is offensive and hate filled. The GOP has nothing to do with this issue. It is a conservative Vs Liberal issue.  Many in the GOP would murder unborn as fast as a liberal would. The conservative point is that all life is protected under the Constitution. We are not talking about victims of rape or other terrible crimes. These cases can be handled by the morning after pill. Do not give me the womans heath issue.  My wife and I work with the DCF and care for foster new born babies . We have adopted kids that would have been abortions had we not saved the babies lives. There are 10s of thousands of incredible people out there waiting to give these babies all the love in the world. Yet the liberal mind says hell no kill that zygote. In rare cases a womans life could be compromised during a pregnancy and the baby must be aborted to save the mothers life. That is very rare. As for you foolish comment on child welfare. Conservatives are for education and a helping hand up. We do not support life long welfare. Conservative do not want kids to go without proper care of any kind.
