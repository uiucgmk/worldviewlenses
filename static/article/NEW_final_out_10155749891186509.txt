My wife and I work with the DCF and care for foster new born babies . We have adopted kids that would have been abortions had we not saved the babies lives. There are 10s of thousands of incredible people out there waiting to give these babies all the love in the world. Yet the liberal mind says hell no kill that zygote. In rare cases a womans life could be compromised during a pregnancy and the baby must be aborted to save the mothers life. That is very rare. As for you foolish comment on child welfare. Conservatives are for education and a helping hand up. We do not support life long welfare. Conservative do not want kids to go without proper care of any kind. What we want is for the states to handle this issue without Federal mandates that choke the system.","10155749891186509_1775219462727317"]

["John, John Kasich, Kasich","positive","Abortion should not be illegal. It should be a service provided to those who choose to use the service. You dont have to agree with abortion  but you also shouldnt decide what others can and cannot do to their bodies...just like I shouldnt decide which doctor you can see  what junk food you choose to eat  whether you smoke or drink...this is a personal decision...leave it to the PERSON to decide. I may or may not agree with abortion  but Im smart enough to know  its NOT my place to make that decision for anyone else  NOR is it my place to judge anyone else for their decisions. So let the people affected make the choice...Good for you Kasich for allowing people to make their own choices!","10155749891186509_1636614216632201"]
