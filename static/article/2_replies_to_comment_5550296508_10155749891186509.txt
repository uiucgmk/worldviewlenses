Third ultrasound is anatomy scan, which is to check fluids again, heart chambers again, and to tell you if you're having a boy or girl, this is done around 18 weeks, but again may vary on your state or provider. That is typically the end of the ultrasounds, unless you have a high risk pregnancy, gestational diabetes, or are measuring behind or ahead, and of course if they can't find a heart beat on your regular visit they will quickly check.

Each of us needs to be able to choose for ourselves WITHOUT interference from the government what we can and cannot do with our bodies and what health needs we have.  The second vital point about keeping abortion legal and safe is that if every woman who needs an abortion has to get a lawyer, go to court, go through ALL of that... the expense and trauma of being forced to prove she was raped or that her health is in jeopardy... she is at the mercy of the court's decision. Lawsuits and investigations take time and money, and by the time it's settled, that girl/woman may have run out of time to actually have the abortion and be forced to endure a horrible pregnancy and birth.  There are millions of girls and women in very difficult living situations: violent, poverty-striken, shamed by her family.  Forcing someone to go through all of that is unacceptable."]

Don't have one. You make it sound like women are just getting pregnant through LAZINESS. No birth control is 100% effective. Many women get pregnant despite using birth control. You do realize that having a child is expensive. Not just medical bills but then time off work, for many without pay! How would you provide for yourself and other family members without getting paid for several weeks? I agree that adoption should be easier and cheaper, but that doesn't alleviate other problems with carrying a baby. How about the pro-birthers do something to legislate guaranteed maternity leave, increase WIC benefits. I worked for a major company when I had my son. I had no maternity leave. When my vacation ran out, they said I was out of a job! They would \"hire me back\" when I was ready to come back if they wanted to. No guarantees. So, after 3 weeks leave, I had no income, had to pay my own and my baby's health insurance 100% out of pocket. Do something to help alleviate the reasons women feel abortion is their only choice and the abortion rates will drop."]

Most organs on a basic ultrasound aren't completely recognizable prior to 18weeks. So, say your 18week routine u/s of a baby you very much want shows something questionable. All other tests have been normal. You now have 2wks to get a 3D u/s with a high risk specialist, a rush amnio, odds are you'd want a second opinion, right(?!), all in 2wks if you were lucky enough to get your u/s on time, which lets be real, isn't usually quite the case. After all of this, multiple specialists confirm this baby is incompatible with life, and as a side not mom, you are showing signs of pre-eclampsia and early stages of liver insufficiency. This is why 24wks makes sense. It gives the grieving parents time to get as much info as they can to make the choice that is right for them and their baby. This is not a decision to rush. They need that time."]

THIRD-term, partial or late-term abortion:\nANY fetus that is  older than 24-28 weeks, healthy and able to live outside the womb w/or w/o supportive care; is delivered, ALIVE! It's called pre-term BIRTH!\nNo State Allows abortion to a HEALTHY baby after 24-28 weeks!! (It was banned in 2003)\nNo doctor, clinic or hospital, aborts a HEALTHY baby for ANY reason if it can live outside the womb-NONE!\nNobody, including Hillary, wanted to change that!\nThe reason for the ninth month allowance that Hillary was referring to, is due to the Catholics making woman carry to term a fetus that has died in the womb, bc they won't allow it to be aborted. Even \nif it will cause the death of the mother!\nThe only time a fetus is aborted after 24-28 weeks is if it is not able to sustain life outside the womb!\nIf a mothers health is at risk after 24-28 weeks she simply gives birth!\n2. Planned  Parenthood as is stands today is the single best way to reduce the need for abortion bc it provides care, planning and education to men and women that they might not receive otherwise!\nLet's not throw things into the equation that have nothing to do with the current situation bc it's just not true anymore!\nIf you don't know all of the above than you are not really concerned about the issue and if you do and choose to spread lies then you are disgusting and willing to lie to further your own agenda!\n3. Women are not responsible for providing babies to people that can't have their own.\n4. Religion has no business in anyone's choice except yours! You do not get to tell anyone else what god or morals rule them!\n5. Until the cerebrum is developed, a fetus is no different than a plant and that is science and fact and not open for debate! Keep your god out of it if you don't believe in science!\n6. \nBirth Control fails.l!\nRape happens!\nIncest happens!\nMolestation happens!\nChoice is the women's alone not yours!\n7.  Foster kids can be fostered and/or adopted, depending on the situation and the state pays you to foster!\n8. Babies can be adopted if a mother is willing to do so! Period. They do not owe anyone a baby!\n9. If you have not walked a mile-stay out of it with your judgements!\n10. Constitutionally pro-choice is the ONLY choice! If you're an American!\n\nThis is part 1 of 2!"]

Republicans before the T-bag and Alt-racist right are the real republicans. We are the Regan era republicans we believe in a government that stands away from personal development and decision, we believe in law and order and and a strong military and a freedom of economic choices. What we should never do is pass laws limiting freedom of choice such as ACA very over reaching if government, but also on the other hand we have to look at the bigger picture of society. Is it better that people have insurance for medical, of course, but do we mandate it no. So how do we stop people from not getting insurance? Well we allow states to federal subsidies for people who don't normally have insurances through employer, for insurance on their own, and restrict any pre-existing conditions non-coverage. The role republicans should take is mostly hands off even at state level and let free market work. We should always take the role of an economist, just as Regan did."]

It takes two to make a baby. It's not all the woman's fault!

There is an action here in our place called 'declaratory relief' where in the end, the court will declare the rights and obligations of people who are affected by contracts or laws. \n\nIf there is also that kind of action in your place, i think it would be better to try that one out."]
