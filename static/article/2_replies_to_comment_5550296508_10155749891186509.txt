THIRD-term, partial or late-term abortion: ANY fetus that is  older than 24-28 weeks, healthy and able to live outside the womb w/or w/o supportive care; is delivered, ALIVE! It's called pre-term BIRTH! No State Allows abortion to a HEALTHY baby after 24-28 weeks!! (It was banned in 2003) No doctor, clinic or hospital, aborts a HEALTHY baby for ANY reason if it can live outside the womb-NONE! Nobody, including Hillary, wanted to change that! The reason for the ninth month allowance that Hillary was referring to, is due to the Catholics making woman carry to term a fetus that has died in the womb, bc they won't allow it to be aborted. Even  if it will cause the death of the mother! The only time a fetus is aborted after 24-28 weeks is if it is not able to sustain life outside the womb! If a mothers health is at risk after 24-28 weeks she simply gives birth! 2. Planned  Parenthood as is stands today is the single best way to reduce the need for abortion bc it provides care, planning and education to men and women that they might not receive otherwise! Let's not throw things into the equation that have nothing to do with the current situation bc it's just not true anymore! If you don't know all of the above than you are not really concerned about the issue and if you do and choose to spread lies then you are disgusting and willing to lie to further your own agenda! 3. Women are not responsible for providing babies to people that can't have their own. 4. Religion has no business in anyone's choice except yours! You do not get to tell anyone else what god or morals rule them! 5. Until the cerebrum is developed, a fetus is no different than a plant and that is science and fact and not open for debate! Keep your god out of it if you don't believe in science! 6.  Birth Control fails.l! Rape happens! Incest happens! Molestation happens! Choice is the women's alone not yours! 7.  Foster kids can be fostered and/or adopted, depending on the situation and the state pays you to foster! 8. Babies can be adopted if a mother is willing to do so! Period. They do not owe anyone a baby! 9. If you have not walked a mile-stay out of it with your judgements! 10. Constitutionally pro-choice is the ONLY choice! If you're an American!  This is part 1 of 2!"]
