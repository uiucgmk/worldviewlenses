You dont get that?nCome on now...nThe Electoral College was a system designed by the framers of the Constitution as a way to make sure that people who lived in lesspopulated rural areas didn have their voices silenced by those living in the more populated cities.nnIt also means that candidates are forced to campaign in states that might not get any attention if the election was based purely on the popular vote. As Donald Trump himself said in a tweet  he would have campaigned in states like California and New York if elections went off of just the overall vote totals. Instead  candidates are forced to campaign in  and listen to the people of  smaller  lesspopulated states like New Hampshire  Wisconsin  North Carolina  Colorado  Nevada  and so on.nnBoth parties know this. That why Barack Obama won his party nomination in   not Hillary Clinton. That why President Bush won the  election despite losing the popular vote.nnWe are not a Democracy we are a Constituional Republic and A Constitutional Republic is a state where the officials are elected as representatives of the people  and must govern according to existing constitutional law that limits the governments power over citizens. A Constitutional Republic is the current form of government in the United States.nnThe whole purpose of the electoral college is to prevent a few states with large populations from running the country. It gives every state more of an equal say.Tthats exactly the purpose  without it a few large Metropolitan areas would run the country.

Instead  candidates are forced to campaign in  and listen to the people of  smaller  lesspopulated states like New Hampshire  Wisconsin  North Carolina  Colorado  Nevada  and so on.nnBoth parties know this.

You dont get that?nCome on now...nThe Electoral College was a system designed by the framers of the Constitution as a way to make sure that people who lived in lesspopulated rural areas didn have their voices silenced by those living in the more populated cities.nnIt also means that candidates are forced to campaign in states that might not get any attention if the election was based purely on the popular vote. As Donald Trump himself said in a tweet  he would have campaigned in states like California and New York if elections went off of just the overall vote totals. Instead  candidates are forced to campaign in  and listen to the people of  smaller  lesspopulated states like New Hampshire  Wisconsin  North Carolina  Colorado  Nevada  and so on.nnBoth parties know this. That why Barack Obama won his party nomination in   not Hillary Clinton. That why President Bush won the  election despite losing the popular vote.nnWe are not a Democracy we are a Constituional Republic and A Constitutional Republic is a state where the officials are elected as representatives of the people  and must govern according to existing constitutional law that limits the governments power over citizens. A Constitutional Republic is the current form of government in the United States.nnThe whole purpose of the electoral college is to prevent a few states with large populations from running the country. It gives every state more of an equal say.Tthats exactly the purpose  without it a few large Metropolitan areas would run the country.
