aS"Why is Donald Trump not meeting with Al Gore one of the foremost specialist in climate change in America. His daughter is not part of our political system. And I am very skeptical that she has any knowledge whatsoever about climate change. Donald seems to think climate change is a ruse to get money from America to China which is absolutely unbelievable. Clearly Donald does not listen to ninety-eight percent of the world scientist that all agree climate change is real. By the year 2025 to 2030 it will be irreversible. There will be famine and weather unlike we have ever experienced in the history of Earth. This is all clearly documented by scientists throughout the world. Donald has the chance to save us from a terrible fate. But he chooses to believe that climate change is not real. I don't even know what to do with someone that's that ignorant."

This is the same First Daughter who  according to the President Elect  he will turn the Operations (not ownership) of his businesses over to  with her brothers  as if that will end his conflict of interest.  Scary thing is as 'unpaid' Advisors there is no reason for them to disclose or discontinue their business connections (son-in-law involved in his own businesses) but gives them direct access to and give opinions on the business of America before many others.  America is getting what they rebelled against many many years ago and that apparently is a 'Royal Family'."
