They give regular pelvic exams to women of child bearing years. They have NO CHOICE. Oftentimes  if a woman becomes pregnant and can not pay the exorbitant fine for violating the \\"One Child\\" policy they are forced to have an abortion. We are not China. Anti-choice pro-birthers are trying to force us to be like China by taking away a woman\'s choice. The government has no place in our choices regarding our reproductive choices.

First of all Marco the use of the word Nazi is offensive and hate filled. The GOP has nothing to do with this issue. It is a conservative -Vs- Liberal issue.  Many in the GOP would murder unborn as fast as a liberal would. The conservative point is that all life is protected under the Constitution. We are not talking about victims of rape or other terrible crimes. These cases can be handled by the morning after pill. Do not give me the woman's heath issue.  My wife and I work with the DCF and care for foster new born babies . We have adopted kids that would have been abortions had we not saved the babies lives. There are 10s of thousands of incredible people out there waiting to give these babies all the love in the world. Yet the liberal mind says hell no kill that zygote. In rare cases a woman's life could be compromised during a pregnancy and the baby must be aborted to save the mothers life. That is very rare. As for you foolish comment on child welfare. Conservatives are for education and a helping hand up. We do not support life long welfare. Conservative do not want kids to go without proper care of any kind.
