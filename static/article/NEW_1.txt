['MR. TRUMP', 'negative', 'Why move to Canada. We can fight for what we want in a positive way!!!!nnJust sign the petition and stop Trump from becoming president.nnOn December   the Electors of the Electoral College will cast their ballots. If they all vote the way their states voted  Donald Trump will win. However  they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed  their vote would still be counted  they would simply pay a small fine.nWe are calling on the Electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton. Why?nMr. Trump is unfit to serve. His scapegoating of so many Americans  and his impulsivity  bullying  lying  admitted history of sexual assault  and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic. nSecretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President. n Hillary won the popular vote. The only reason Trump won is because of the Electoral College.nBut the Electoral College can actually give the White House to either candidate. So why not use this most undemocratic of our institutions to ensure a democratic result?nSHE WON THE POPULAR VOTE.nThere is no reason Trump should be President.nIts the Peoples WillnNo. She won the popular vote.nOur system of government under our Constitution says he winsnNo. Our Constitution says the Electors choose.nToo many states prohibit Faithless Electorsn states bind electors. If electors vote against their party  they usually pay a fine. And people get mad. But they can vote however they want and there is no legal means to stop them in most states.nnPLEASE SIGN AND SHARE! This is a petition!!!!nnhttps://www.change.org/p/electoralcollegeelectorselectoralcollegemakehillaryclintonpresidentondecember?recruiter=andutmsource=sharepetitionandutmmedium=facebookandutmcampaign=autopublishandutmterm=mobxsnosrcnomsg', '10155584306476509_1011268765666427']
